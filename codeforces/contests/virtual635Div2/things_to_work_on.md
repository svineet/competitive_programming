Things to work on
=================

Triangle math for competitive programming
what the fuck even are triangles.

Nevermind the triangles sorted themselves out.

What is up with graphs tho?

Learning
--------

Inversion. I was thinking about C as selecting industry spots, while the solution approaches
it from the other side by selecting tourist spots instead. While there is a pattern there,
it's harder to divine for industry spots than tourist spots.

*Lesson*: Try to invert the problem statement, if you can select n-k tourist spots instead of
k industry spots.
